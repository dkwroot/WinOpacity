WinOpacity Application

What is does:
This application allows you to change the opacity of a window in your operating system allowing you to see through a window and at a window beneath it.
It also allows you to toggle whether a window is always on top and if it can be clicked-through allowing you to click on windows beneath it.

Why it's useful:
You can do things like make your video player see through and then draw on a paint application beneath it, essentially making it easy to rotoscope.
You could also use it to pin videos or notes to parts of your screen and keep them there while you work.

How to Install:
Simply download the zip file to your system and unzip it. Inside you will find an exe file, just run it and you're done.

Requirements:
The application only works on windows machines. I have tested it on windows 10 and 11.
